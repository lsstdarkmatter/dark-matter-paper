In this section, we provide a brief review of several theoretical models of dark matter with a specific focus on the properties of these models that can be explored by LSST. 
We divide the domain of models into three different categories. 
We first discuss reasonably minimal extensions of the popular cold, collisionless particle dark matter paradigm (\secref{particles}). 
We then extend our discussion to much lighter axion-like particle and wave-like dark matter (\secref{axions}). 
Finally, we discuss the potential to constrain alternative compact dark matter models, with a focus on primordial black holes (\secref{machos}).
We stress that exploring a broad theoretical landscape with LSST is strongly motivated by the lack of an experimental discovery of a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) or other conventional CDM particle candidate.
