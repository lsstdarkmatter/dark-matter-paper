LSST will uniquely complement several other experimental studies of dark matter.
Below we summarize some of these complementary probes, with a specific focus on spectroscopic observations, high-resolution imaging, indirect detection experiments, and direct detection experiments.
While LSST can substantially improve our understanding of dark matter in isolation, these experiments are essential to provide a holistic picture of dark matter physics.
This section is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather serves to demonstrate the influence that LSST will have on dark matter studies generally.

The power of photometric and astrometric measurements from LSST will be significantly augmented by additional spectroscopic observations.
In particular, spectroscopic follow-up studies will provide kinematic and redshift information for many of the objects studied by LSST.
Given the faintness and high density of targets that are expected from LSST, community access to multi-object spectrographs on large-aperture telescopes is essential for these studies \citep{2016arXiv161001661N}. 
Due to LSST's location in the southern hemisphere, southern spectroscopic facilities are best at maximizing observational overlap.

Many next-generation telescopes and instruments are currently under development or construction. 
These facilities can be broadly divided into two categories: wide-field, massively multiplexed spectroscopy on medium- to large-aperture telescopes ($\roughly$8--10-meter class), and giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs, $\roughly30$-meter class) with relatively smaller fields of view. 
%These instruments can be broadly divided into two categories: massively multiplexed spectrographs on 8- to 10-meter telescopes, and giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs, $\roughly 30$-meter class) with smaller fields of view. 
The former category includes facilities on existing and future telescopes including the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) instrument on the Subaru telescope \citep{2014PASJ...66R...1T} that is currently under construction; the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer \citep[MSE;][]{MSEbook2018}, a planned 11.25m, wide-field, optical and near-infrared facility completely dedicated to multi-object spectroscopy; the Southern Spectroscopic Survey Instrument (SSSI), a project concept recommended for consideration by the DOEâ€™s Cosmic Visions panel \citep{1604.07626, 1604.07821}, and a possible future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility. 
The latter category is populated by new facilities such as the Thirty Meter Telescope \citep[TMT;][]{1505.01195}, the Giant Magellan Telescope \citep[GMT;][]{GMT:2018}, and the Extremely Large Telescope \citep[ELT;][]{EELT:2009}.

In this section, we illustrate several examples of how complementary spectroscopy will improve the measurement of dark matter properties with LSST.

\subsection{Milky Way Satellite Galaxies \Contact{Josh}}\label{sec:MW_sats_spec}
%\Contributors{Josh, Ting, Erik, ...}
In \secref{smallest_galaxies} we discussed the derivation of an upper limit on the minimum dark matter halo mass based on the observed luminosity function of satellites discovered by LSST. 
%\ET{Should we mention the fact that confirmation of the LSST discoveries *also* may require spectroscopy at least for some of the ambiguous cases?}  
An alternative approach is to obtain spectroscopy of individual stars in each satellite to measure its velocity dispersion, from which the central mass and density can be inferred.  Then one can compare either the densities or the circular velocity function directly with theoretical predictions without assumptions about the subhalo mass function or the stellar mass-halo mass relation.


Spectroscopy of individual stars in the faint Milky Way satellites that will be identified with LSST will require deep observations with multiplexed spectrographs on large telescopes.  Measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions of these systems can be obtained either with 8--10-meter-class telescopes or with the next generation of 25--30-meter-class telescopes.  To assess the feasibility of spectroscopy of LSST satellites, we create a mock sample of dwarfs based on projections of the sensitivity of LSST satellite searches. We estimate the limiting magnitude set by targeting the brightest 20 stars in each simulated dwarf and apply exposure time calculators for Keck/DEIMOS and GMT/GMACS to determine the integration time needed for each satellite, with the additional constraint that no object would be observed for more than 30 hours ($\sim3$~nights).
As illustrated in \figref{specfollowup_distance}, spectroscopy of a nearly complete sample of satellites can be pushed $\roughly 2$~mag fainter in luminosity and a factor of $\roughly 2$ farther in distance with plausible investments of observing time on a GSMT than with existing facilities.

In addition to inferring the minimum dark matter halo mass, kinematics from stellar spectroscopy can also reveal the inner densities of the lowest-luminosity dwarf galaxies, for which baryonic effects are minimal and dark matter physics can be separated from the astrophysics of galaxy formation \citep{governato2012,read2017}. \AHGP{Problem: Justin read shows that density profile measurement requires about a thousand stars.  It's (relatively) easy to get a central density, hard to do a profile.} A direct measurement of the inner density in these dwarf galaxies will allow us to distinguish between collisionless CDM,  which predicts a cuspy NFW profile, and SIDM, which predicts lower central densities \citep[][though see \citealt{Nishikawa:2019lsc}]{2012MNRAS.423.3740V,Rocha:2012jg}. Moreover, the stellar kinematics will also reveal the integral of the dark matter density profile in dwarf galaxies (i.e., the J-factor), which is an essential input for constraints on the dark matter self-annihilation cross section for indirect dark matter searches in X-ray and $\gamma$-ray experiments \citep[\eg,][]{1108.3546}.

\subsection{Stellar Streams \Contact{Ting}}
%\Contributors{Ting, Denis ...}

As discussed in \secref{stream_gaps}, subhalo encounters with cold stellar streams will induce density perturbations that will be detectable by LSST, constraining the minimum dark matter halo mass and the mass function of dark matter halos from $\roughly10^5$--$10^9 \Msun$. In addition, these flybys cause velocity perturbations that correlate with the density variations.  The velocity signal near stream gaps can be measured either via line-of-sight velocity measurements from spectroscopy or tangential velocity measurements from astrometry, improving the precision with which the perturber mass can be determined.
The velocity variation (peak to peak) from these flybys will be small. To estimate the amplitude of the perturbation, we consider a stream orbiting the Milky Way at a distance of 14 kpc and compute the typical maximum velocity kick expected over its lifetime of 5 Gyr using the formalism from \citet{erkal2016}.  The velocity change is $\roughly \{0.6, 0.3, 0.1\} \kms$ for subhalos in the range $\{ 10^{7.5}, 10^{6.5}, 10^{5.5} \} \Msun$, respectively. %$\{ 10^7-10^8, 10^6-10^7, 10^5-10^6\} \Msun$

Due to the low density of the stream stars, a massively multiplexed, wide field-of-view spectroscopic facility such as PFS on Subaru or MSE is needed. 
Furthermore, given the expected small velocity kick amplitude, the velocity for each star determined from the spectroscopic observation need to be extremely precise.
%Furthermore, given the expected small velocity kick amplitude, the velocity accuracy for each star determined from the spectroscopic observations should be at or better than $1 \kms$ to unambiguously detect the signal with an ensemble of stream stars. 
Considering that the typical gap size for a $10^6 M_\odot$ subhalo is a few degrees, and the typical known streams has 10--100 stars/degree at $r\lesssim23$ \citep[\eg,][]{erkal2017, DeBoer:2018}, a velocity precision of $\sim1\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ per star would allow an unambiguously detection on the signal with an ensemble of stream stars.  


\subsection{Galaxy Clusters \Contact{Will}}
%\Contributors{Will, ...}

%As noted in \secref{merging_clusters}, one of largest systematics associated with merging galaxy cluster constraints on SIDM is modeling the merger. The more complex the merger, the more severe the systematics will be.
%The best means of constraining merging galaxy cluster substructure is with spectroscopic measurement of as many 
%galaxy cluster member galaxies as possible \citep[\eg,][]{Golovich:2018}.
%As noted in \citet{2016arXiv161001661N}, perhaps the best spectroscopic follow-up facilities are large telescopes with slitmask-like multi-object spectrographs, or fiber-based multiplex spectrometers with low ($\mathcal{O}(\unit{arcsec})$) fiber collision regions, due to the density of cluster members.

As noted in \secref{merging_clusters} one of largest systematics associated with merging galaxy cluster constraints on SIDM is modeling the merger dynamics, most importantly the relative speed at the time of
pericenter. This can be inferred from the observed line-of-sight speed by correcting for the viewing angle and evolving the equations of motion back to the time of pericenter. Therefore, a minimal requirement is a good measurement of the systemic line-of-sight speed of each subcluster, which implies spectroscopic redshifts for hundreds of members of each subcluster \citep[\eg,][]{Golovich:2018}. In addition, a thorough spectroscopic survey of the surrounding $\sim$10 arcmin region is required to test for the presence of additional substructures that could affect reconstruction of the merger scenario. 10-m class collecting area is sufficient for most known mergers, but because member galaxies can be packed quite closely in their respective subclusters, fiber collision avoidance is a limiting factor for many instruments designed for wide-field highly multiplexed spectroscopy.  As noted in \citet{2016arXiv161001661N}, perhaps the best spectroscopic follow-up facilities are large telescopes with slitmask-like multi-object spectrographs, or fiber-based multiplex spectrographs with low ($\mathcal{O}(\unit{arcsec})$) fiber collision regions.

% High-resolution imaging
\section{High-Resolution Imaging}
\label{sec:highres}

\Contributors{William A.\ Dawson, Christopher D.\ Fassnacht, Charles R.\ Keeton, David Wittman, Marc Moniez}

Since the LSST point spread function (PSF) is limited to a median angular resolution of $\roughly 0.7\arcsec$ by a combination of instrumental and  atmospheric effects \citep{0805.2366}, there are many dark matter science cases where higher resolution imaging from space or ground-based adaptive optics (AO) facilities, which can reach $\roughly 0.01\arcsec$ in some cases, can be highly complementary. We briefly summarize some of these cases in this subsection and relate them to the dark matter science capabilities of LSST.
\WAD{This section currently focuses on high resolution optical imaging, however it is worth considering other wavelengths, especially radio.}

% Astrometric microlensing of compact dark matter
\subsection{Astrometric Microlensing}
%\subsection{Astrometric Microlensing of Compact Dark Matter \Contact{Will}}
\label{sec:astrometric_microlens}
%\Contributors{Will, ...}

Related to photometric microlensing (\secref{microlensing}), astrometric microlensing relies on the fact that the two images generated during a compact object lensing event will be of differing brightness, and the brightness ratio of these two images will vary throughout the duration of the lensing event.
The two images will be of most similar brightness when the projected lens-source separation is at its minimum.
By precisely measuring the astrometry of these blended images as a function of time and combining with the LSST photometric microlensing measurement one can break the lens mass-distance degeneracy and precisely measure the mass and location of individual black holes \citep{2015ApJ...814L..11Y}.
Astrometric microlensing will require precise astrometry from ground-based optical/NIR systems, space-based observatories, or longer microwave or radio wavelength observations.
Astrometric microlensing may even give access to less compact dark matter substructures \citep{1804.01991}.

In addition, high cadence, around the clock monitoring of microlensing events will be possible from organized teams of small- to medium-sized telescopes (\eg, MiNDSTEp\footnote{http://www.mindstep-science.org/}, RoboNet\footnote{https://robonet.lco.global/}, MicroFUN\footnote{http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~microfun/}, and PLANET\footnote{http://planet.iap.fr/}). 
These follow-up observations will be sensitive to distorsions with respect to the point-source, point-lens rectilinear approximation.
It will be critical that these collaborations receive automated alerts when LSST detects probable microlensing, or generically non-standard, transient events. 
Such efforts are planned as part of the LSST Alert Stream \citep{0805.2366}.

%These teams are currently fed by the MOA and OGLE-IV alert systems, and could be in perfect synergy with the LSST microlensing detections, providing extra information on individual events that cannot be extracted from the LSST data alone.

% Strong-microlensing
\subsection{Strong Microlensing \Contact{Will Dawson}}
%\subsection{Strong-Microlensing of Compact Dark Matter \Contact{Will Dawson}}
Strong microlensing is related to astrometric microlensing.
The Einstein radius of a given lens, which is approximately the separation of the multiple images in a compact object lensing scenario, scales as $\sqrt{M_\mathrm{lens}}$.
In the intermediate mass black hole range, the separation of the two images approaches that of the resolution of various optical ground and spaced-based telescopes (\figref{strong_microlensing}).
If the multiple images can be resolved and their flux ratio measured, precise measurements of the mass and distance of the lens are achievable.

% Merging Galaxy Clusters
\subsection{Merging Galaxy Clusters and Cluster Subhalos}
%\Contributors{Will D., Dave W., ...}

Most dark matter constraints from merging galaxy clusters (\secref{halo_profile_clusters}) and cluster subhalos (\secref{halo_profile_clusters}) rely on accurately measuring the distribution of dark matter in (sub)clusters via gravitational lensing.
Strong and weak gravitational lensing both benefit from high-resolution imaging.
For strong lensing, high-resolution imaging enables better detection and characterization of strongly lensed background images in the dense cluster environment.
Similarly high-resolution imaging provides $\roughly4$ times more lensed source galaxies per unit area than ground-based imaging at similar depths, which enable higher-resolution weak gravitational lensing.
Historically, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided this higher-resolution imaging, although space-based telescopes such as JWST, Euclid, and WFIRST may take on most of this burden in the era of LSST.

% Strong gravitational lensing
\subsection{Strong Gravitational Lensing}
\label{sec:SLcomplement}
%\Contributors{Chris F.} 

All three approaches to use strong gravitational lens systems to make inferences on the nature of dark matter  described in \secref{stronglens} utilize LSST as a lens-finding facility.
Once the lenses are found, the dark matter science requires follow-up observations with other facilities.
The flux-ratio anomaly approach requires imaging that spatially resolves the lensed images from each other at a wavelength at which microlensing does not affect the image fluxes.
These observations can be in optical/near-IR wavelengths, utilizing IFU spectrographs behind the adaptive optics systems on ELTs to isolate the emission from the narrow-line regions of the lensed AGN, at mid-IR wavelengths with JWST, or at radio wavelengths for the subset of LSST lenses that are radio-loud.
The gravitational imaging and power-spectrum approaches both require milliarcsecond-scale angular resolution imaging for best results.
These observations require either ELT adaptive optics imaging or VLBI radio imaging of the targets.
ALMA can also be used in its most extended configuration, although this will not achieve as high a resolution as the ELTs and VLBI in most cases.
\NEW{SKA is expected to greatly increase the number of radio-detected strong lenses by several orders of magnitude \citep[\eg][]{2015aska.confE..84M}.}
