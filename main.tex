%  D. Hitlin   9/23/03   derived from the BABAR Physics Book format

%  To use LATEX with this format, you must have the follwing files

%  tcibook.cls
%  fancyhea.sty
%  work.sty
%  epsfig.sty
%  workshopsym.tex       This file provides macros for many common symbols
%                         Using these macros will provide uniformity of notation
%                         for the basic particle symbols, units, etc.

%  These provide the page size, type style, headings, etc.
