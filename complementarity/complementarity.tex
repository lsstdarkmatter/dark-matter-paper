\bigskip

The LSST data set will uniquely complement many other experimental studies of dark matter.
Below we summarize some of these complementary probes, with a specific focus on spectroscopic observations, high resolution imaging, indirect detection experiments, and direct detection experiments.
While LSST can substantial improve our understanding of dark matter in isolation, support of these experiments is essential to provide an comprehensive picture of dark matter physics.
This section is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather serves to demonstrate the influence that LSST will have on dark matter studies generally.

% Spectroscopy
\section{Spectroscopy \Contact{Ting}}
 \Contributors{Josh S., Ting L., Erik T., ...}
 \label{sec:spectroscopy}

%(TL: do we want to make a table to compare the specs of various spectroscopy facility. I do not think this is the scope of this paper...) ADW: I agree, this seems beyond our scope%\TL{need to check if ESO wide-field instrument has a name already or not}

While the photometric and astrometric measurements from LSST alone are quite powerful, their impact can be significantly augmented by additional spectroscopic observations. 
In particular, spectroscopic follow-up studies will provide kinematic and redshifts information for many of the objects studied by LSST.
Given the faintness and high density of targets that are expected from LSST, community access to multi-object spectrograph on large aperture telescopes is essential for these studies \citep{2016arXiv161001661N}. 
Due to LSST's location in the southern hemisphere, southern spectroscopic facilities are best, as this  maximizes the overlapping sky area.

Many next-generation telescopes and instruments are currently under preparation or construction. These instruments are broadly divide into two categories: massively multiplexed spectrographs on 8 to 10-meter telescopes, and giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs, $\sim30$-meter class) with smaller field of view. The former category includes facilities on exisiting and future telescopes including the Southern Spectroscopic Survey Instrument (SSSI), a project recommended for consideration by the DOEâ€™s Cosmic Visions panel \citep{1604.07626, 1604.07821}, the Primary Focus Spectrograph (PFS) instrument on the Subaru telescope \citep{2014PASJ...66R...1T}, the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer \citep[MSE;][]{MSEbook2018}, and a possible future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility. 
The latter category is populated by new facilities such as Thirty Meter Telescope \citep[TMT;][]{1505.01195}, the Giant Magellan Telescope \citep[GMT;][]{GMT:2018}, and the European Extremely Large Telescope \citep[E-ELT;][]{EELT:2009}. 

In this section, we illustrate several examples of how complementary spectroscopy will improve the measurements on the dark matter properties with LSST.

\subsection{Milky Way Dwarfs \Contact{Josh}}
\Contributors{Josh, Ting, Erik, ...}
In Section~\ref{sec:smallest_galaxies} we discussed the derivation of an upper limit on the minimum dark matter halo mass based only on the observed luminosity function of satellites discovered by LSST. \ET{Should we mention the fact that confirmation of the LSST discoveries *also* may require spectroscopy at least for some of the ambiguous cases?}  An alternative approach is to obtain spectroscopy of individual stars in each satellite to measure its velocity dispersion, from which the central mass and density can be inferred.  Then one can compare either the densities or the circular velocity function directly with theoretical predictions without assumptions about the subhalo mass function or the stellar mass-halo mass relation.

Spectroscopy of individual stars in the faint Milky Way satellites that will be identified with LSST will require deep observations with multiplexed spectrographs on large telescopes.  Measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions of these systems can be obtained either with 8-10~m-class telescopes or with the next generation of 25-30~m telescopes.  As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:specfollowup_distance}, spectroscopy of a nearly complete sample of satellites can be pushed $\sim2$~mag fainter in luminosity and a factor of $\sim2$ farther in distance with plausible investments of observing time on a GSMT than with existing facilities.

In additional to inferring the minimum dark matter halo mass, kinematics from stellar spectroscopy can also reveal the density profile of the dwarf galaxies at the lowest luminosities, in which the baryonic effects are minimum and therefore dark matter physics can be separated from the astrophysics of galaxy formation (cite). A direct measurement of the density profile in these dwarf galaxies will allow us to distinguish between collisionless CDM  which predicts a cusp NFW profile, and SIDM which predicts a core profile (cite). Moreover, the stellar kinematics will also reveal the integral of the dark matter density profile in the dwarf galaxy (or J-factor), which is an essential input for the constraints on the dark matter self-annihilation cross section for the indirect dark matter search in X-ray and gamma-ray experiments \citep[e.g.][]{1108.3546}.

\subsection{Stellar Streams \Contact{Ting}}
\Contributors{Ting, Denis ...}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stream_gaps}, subhalo encounters with cold stellar streams will induce density perturbations that will be detectable by LSST, constraining the minimum dark matter halo mass and the mass function of dark matter halos from $\sim10^{5} - 10^{9}$~M$_{\odot}$. In addition, these flybys cause velocity perturbations that correlate with the density variations.  The velocity signal near stream gaps can be measured either via line-of-sight velocity measurements from spectroscopy or tangential velocity measurements from astrometry, improving the precision with which the perturber mass can be determined.
The velocity variation (peak to peak) from these flybys will be small. To estimate the amplitude of the perturbation, we consider a stream orbiting the Milky Way at a distance of 14 kpc and compute the typical maximum velocity kick expected over its lifetime of 5 Gyr using the formalism from \cite{erkal2016}.  The velocity change is $\sim$0.6, 0.3, 0.1 km/s for subhalos in the range $10^7-10^8 M_\odot$, $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$, $10^5 -10^6 M_\odot$ respectively. Due to the low density of the stream stars, a massively multiplexed, wide field-of-view spectroscopic facility such as PFS on Subaru or MSE is needed. Furthermore, given the expected small velocity kick amplitude, the velocity accuracy for each star determined from the spectroscopic observations should be at or better than 1 km/s to unambiguously detect the signal with an ensemble of stream stars.

\subsection{Galaxy Clusters \Contact{Will}}
\Contributors{Will, ...}
As noted in \S\ref{sec:merging_clusters} one of largest systematics associated with merging galaxy cluster constraints of SIDM is modeling the merger. The more complex the merger the more severe the systematics.
The best means of constraining merging galaxy cluster substructure is with spectroscopic measurement of as many galaxy cluster member galaxies as possible \cite[see e.g.,][]{2018arXiv180610619G}.
As noted in \cite{2016arXiv161001661N}, perhaps the best spectroscopic follow-up facilities are large telescopes with slitmask-like multi-object spectrometers, or fiber-based multiplex spectrometers with low ($\mathcal{O}(arcsec)$) fiber collision regions, due to the density of cluster members.

% High-resolution imaging
\section{High-Resolution Imaging \Contact{Will}}
\Contributors{Will, ...}
\label{sec:highres}

Since the LSST point spread function (PSF) is limited to an angular resolution of $\sim 0.5\arcsec$ by the atmospheric seeing, there are many dark matter science cases where higher resolution imaging from space or ground-based adaptive optics (AO) facilities, which can reach $\sim 0.01\arcsec$ in some cases, can be highly complementary. We briefly summarize some of these cases in this subsection and relate them to the dark matter science capabilities of LSST.
\WAD{This section currently focuses on high resolution optical imaging, however it is worth considering other wavelengths, especially radio.}

% Astrometric microlensing of compact dark matter
\subsection{Astrometric Microlensing of Compact Dark Matter \Contact{Will}}
\Contributors{Will, ...}
\label{sec:astrometric_microlens}
Related to photometric microlensing (\S\ref{sec:microlensing}), astrometric microlensing relies on the fact that the two images generated during a compact object lensing event will be of differing brightness, and the brightness ratio of these two images will vary throughout the duration of the lensing event.
The two images will be of most similar brightness when the projected lens-source separation is at its minimum.
By precisely measuring the astrometry of these blended images as a function of time and combining with the LSST photometric microlensing measurement one can break the lens mass-distance degeneracy and precisely measure the mass and location of individual black holes \cite{2015ApJ...814L..11Y}.

% Strong-microlensing
\subsection{Strong-Microlensing of Compact Dark Matter \Contributors{Will, ...}}
Strong-microlensing is related to astrometric microlensing (\S\ref{sec:astrometric_microlens}).
The Einstein radius of a given lens, which is approximately the separation of the multiple images in a compact object lensing scenario, scales as $\sqrt{M_\mathrm{lens}}$.
In the intermediate mass black hole range, the separation of the two images approaches that of the resolution of various optical ground and spaced-based telescopes, see Figure \ref{fig:strong_microlensing}.
If the multiple images can be resolved and their flux ratio measured it enables precise measurement of the mass and distance of the lens.

% Merging Galaxy Clusters
\subsection{Merging Galaxy Clusters and Cluster Subhalos}
\Contributors{Will D., Dave W., ...}

Most dark matter constraints from merging galaxy clusters (\secref{halo_profile_clusters}) and cluster subhalos (\secref{halo_profile_clusters}) rely on accurately measuring the distribution of dark matter in (sub)clusters via gravitational lensing.
Strong and weak gravitational lensing both benefit from high resolution imaging.
For strong lensing the high resolution imaging enables better detection and characterization of strongly lensed background images in the dense cluster environment.
Similarly high resolution imaging provides $\sim4$ times more lensed source galaxies per unit area than ground-based imaging at similar depths, which enable higher resolution weak gravitational lensing.
Historically Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided this higher resolution imaging, although in the era of LSST it appears that we will rely on space-based telescopes such as JWST, Euclid, and WFIRST.
There is also the potential to leverage future wide field AO instruments \WAD{Need to provide and example.}.

% Strong gravitational lensing
\subsection{Strong Gravitational Lensing}
\label{sec:SLcomplement}
\Contributors{Chris F.} 

All three approaches to use strong gravitational lens systems to make inferences on the nature of dark matter that were described in \secref{stronglens} utilize LSST as a lens-finding facility.
Once the lenses are found, the dark matter science requires follow-up observations with other facilities.
The flux-ratio anomaly approach requires imaging that spatially resolves the lensed images from each other at a wavelength at which microlensing does not affect the image fluxes.
These observations can be in optical/near-IR wavelengths, utilizing IFU spectrographs behind the adaptive optics systems on ELTs to isolate the emission from the narrow-line regions of the lensed AGN, at mid-IR wavelengths with JWST, or at radio wavelengths for the subset of LSST lenses that is radio-loud.
The gravitational imaging and power-spectrum approaches both require milliarcsecond-scale angular resolution imaging for best results.
These observations require either ELT adaptive optics imaging or VLBI radio imaging of the targets.
ALMA can also be used in its most extended configuration, although this will not achieve as high a resolution as the ELTs and VLBI in most cases.

% Direct Detection
\section{Direct Detection }
\ADW{Some introduction and context is needed here. Much of Lina's intro could be moved here.}

\subsection{Baryon Scattering \Contact{Vera}}
\Contributors{Vera, Kim, Lina N.}

The most sensitive low-energy searches for dark matter are looking to directly detect collisions of dark matter particles from the local galactic halo in underground detectors \citep{2013arXiv1310.8327C}. 
They have unprecedented sensitivity to WIMPs with masses well above a GeV, but the current generation of experiments is largely insensitive to lighter particles, for kinematic reasons. 
New technologies are necessary to open up sub-GeV models of dark matter to detailed exploration \citep{Battaglieri:2017aum}. 
Moreover, due to the extensive shielding of their targets, direct detection experiments have a ceiling on their sensitivity to large cross sections. 
The portion of dark matter parameter space excluded by current null results is shown in \figref{dd}. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/planck_dd.png}
\caption{Currently-excluded regions of dark matter parameter space (mass versus cross section for scattering with protons through a velocity-independent spin-independent contact interaction) are shown as shaded regions. Gray region is excluded by various direct detection null results \citep{2018PhRvD..97l3013K} and red is excluded by CMB measurements \citep{Gluscevic:2017ywp}. We note that there are other limits in the same parameter space, but we choose to compare only these two, for illustration of complementarity between cosmological and low-energy laboratory searches.}
\label{fig:dd}
\end{figure}

Current null results from targeted laboratory searches motivate broad scans of parameter space that is inaccessible to underground experiments. Cosmological and astrophysical observables provide such a complementary search strategy. In particular, they are sensitive to scattering of sub-GeV particles with baryons at any point in cosmic history. Furthermore, there is no upper boundary on the interaction cross section they can probe. Finally, they are not subject to the uncertainty on local astrophysical properties of dark matter particles (their phase-space distribution), which affects the inferred limits on the particle properties of dark matter. 

If dark matter particles scatter with baryons, they transfer momentum between the two cosmological fluids, affecting density fluctuations and suppressing power at small scales; the power suppression can be captured by a variety of observables. The current limits come from the CMB \citep{Gluscevic:2017ywp}, cosmic-ray \citep{Cappiello:2018hsu}, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements \cite{Xu:2018efh}. For illustration, Figure \ref{fig:dd} compares currently excluded regions of dark matter parameter space, from analyses of Planck data, and from null results of various direct-detection searches.\footnote{We caution the reader that this is not a comprehensive list of current upper limits, but only serves to illustrate complementarity of cosmological and direct detection probes.} LSST will deliver state-of-the-art measurements of observables that trace matter fluctuations on a range of smaller scales, extending the sensitivity of astrophysical and cosmological searches far beyond the reach of Planck.

\subsection{Local Dark Matter Velocity Distribution \Contact{Lina}}
\Contributors{Lina N.}

%One way to detect dark matter (DM) is a process called direct detection, where DM particles scatter off heavy nuclei, emitting scintillation/ionization light that provide a direct signal of DM \citep{Goodman:1984dc}. 

The signal strength of dark matter (DM) scattering in direct detection experiments depends on both the local DM density and the DM velocity distribution. In this section we focus on the DM velocity distribution.

The differential rate with respect to the recoil energy $dR/dQ$ depends on the integral of the DM velocity distribution, $f(v)$, as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dR}{dQ} \propto \int_{v_{\rm{min}}}^{v_{\rm{esc}}} \frac{f(v)}{v} dv, 
\end{equation}
where $v_{\rm{min}} = \sqrt{Q m_N/ (2 \mu^2)}$, with $Q$ the recoil energy, $m_N$ the mass of the nucleus against which DM is scattering, and $\mu = (m_N m_\chi / (m_N + m_\chi))$ the reduced mass of the nucleus $m_N$ and the DM mass $m_\chi$.

A novel method has recently been proposed to use the stars as tracers for the DM velocity \citep{Herzog-Arbeitman:2017fte,Necib:2018b}. These papers suggest that since accreted DM and stars have a comment origin, and are both collisionless, accreted stars are able to trace the velocity distribution of DM. This correlation holds for both the relaxed component of the DM, traced by older metal poor stars, and DM velocity substructure called debris flow traced by less metal poor stars from more recent mergers \citep{Lisanti:2011as,Kuhlen:2012fz,Lisanti:2014dva}. 

This method has already been applied on RAVE-TGAS data \citep{Herzog-Arbeitman:2017zbm}, and the second data release of Gaia in \cite{necib2018}. It has been found that the relaxed component of the DM although isotropic, has a mean speed lower than that of the assumed Maxwell Boltzmann distribution, reducing current limits by direct detection experiments \citep{Aprile:2018dbl}.

Another interesting aspect is the ability to reconstruct of more recent mergers. Using the second data release of Gaia, a new merger called the Gaia Sausage or the Gaia Enceleadus \citep{2018MNRAS.477.1472B,2018Natur.563...85H} has been found. Using the correlation observed in simulations, \cite{necib2018} extracted the new velocity distribution of DM brought in by the same merger, and studied its implications in current direct detection experiments. 

In order to do obtain the full empirical distribution of DM, one needs the 3-d velocities of the stars in the local neighborhood. Gaia provides proper motion and parallaxes for stars down to 20th magnitude. LSST will be able to extend this dataset to fainter stars, giving us a more accurate measurement of proper motions of stars in the solar neighborhood and beyond.

 Using proper motions of stars from LSST, coupled with radial velocity measurements from future telescopes like MSE, we will be able to obtain the most accurate 3-d velocity measurements of the local stars, and subsequently use this information to obtain a full empirical measurement of DM. Such detailed analysis will unveil new structures much smaller than the Gaia Sausage, but with equal importance in DM direct detection if it passes by the Solar neighborhood.

Consider removing this section for now. Points to potentially consider in the future:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-correlation science.
    \item CMB limits on dark matter-baryon and dark matter-dark radiation interactions are robust, but probe large scales. Smaller-scale probes (dwarfs etc) have a better discovery potential.
    \item In a meta-analysis where many observables are fit with all parameters of interest, we'd want to vary all LCDM parameters. We'd use CMB data for this, in a joint likelihood analysis. But we're not there yet.
