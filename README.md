# LSST Dark Matter Paper

This repository is intended to serve as a rallying point to collect code, content, and conversations related to the LSST Dark Matter white paper. It has largely been developed during LSSTC-funded dark matter workshops including a [Pitt PACC workshop](https://lsstdarkmatter.github.io/PreviousWorkshops/pitt2018/index.html) in March 2018 and a [Livermore workshop](https://lsstdarkmatter.github.io/) in October 2018.

Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/lsstdarkmatter/dark-matter-paper/issues) page for a list of hack projects and to-do's.
