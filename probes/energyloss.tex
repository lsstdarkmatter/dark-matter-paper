Observations of stars provide a mechanism to probe temperatures, particle densities, and time scales that are inaccessible to laboratory experiments.
Since conventional astrophysics allows us to quantitatively model the evolution of stars, the detailed study of stellar populations can provide a powerful technique to probe new physics.
In particular, if new light particles exist and are coupled to Standard Model fields, their emission would provide an additional channel for energy loss. 
Such anomalous energy loss mechanisms would change the time that stars spend in specific stellar evolutionary phases.
Such deviations are a robust predictions of light, weakly coupled particles, and the general agreement between observations and Standard Model predictions has been used to constrain the properties of many types of new particles \citep{hep-ph/0611350, 1210.1271, 1302.3884, 1305.2920, 1611.03864, 1611.05852, 1803.00993}.

While the predictions of the Standard Model are broadly consistent with observations of stellar evolution, several independent observations have shown a systematic preference for an additional subdominant energy-loss mechanism (see \citealt{Giannotti:2017hny} for a recent review).
These observations include red giants branch (RGB) stars, in particular the luminosity of the tip of the branch~\citep{Viaux:2013lha,Viaux:2013hca}; 
horizontal branch stars (HB), specifically by comparing the number of HB and RGB stars~\citep{Ayala:2014,Straniero:2015nvc};
variable white dwarf (WD) stars, for which the cooling efficiency was extracted from the rate of the period change~\citep{KeplerEtAl,Isern:1992gia,BischoffKim:2007ve,Corsico:2012ki,Corsico:2012sh,Corsico:2014mpa,Corsico:2016okh,Battich:2016htm}; 
and the WD luminosity function (WDLF), which describes the distribution of WDs as a function of their luminosity~\citep{Isern:2008nt,Bertolami:2014wua,Isern:2018uce}.
Observed discrepancies between these stellar measurements and predictions from conventional models of stellar cooling can be interpreted as the need for additional energy loss (\figref{axions}).
\cite{Giannotti:2015kwo} provide a systematic analysis of the new-physics interpretation of stellar observations  where cooling anomalies have been reported, and they conclude that axions and ALPs are the best candidates to account for the observed discrepancies. 
While these `hints' of anomalous cooling represent subdominant deviations to broadly successful models of stellar evolution, it is imperative to explore possible signatures of new physics when they arise.

LSST will greatly improve our understanding of stellar evolution by providing unprecedented photometry, astrometry, and temporal sampling for a large sample of faint stars \citep{0912.0201}.
These observations will allow us to better assess the significance of claimed anomalies, and will further guide constraints on (or detection of) new physics.
A better understanding of astrophysical energy transport will ultimately help shed light on the physics of light, weakly-coupled particles and will offer an invaluable guide to future experimental searches for axions and ALPs~\citep{Irastorza:2018dyq}.

\subsection{White Dwarf Luminosity Function}

The white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) plays a particularly significant role in our understanding of stellar cooling and offers a fundamental method to test new physics.
Measurements of the slope of the WDLF can probe additional energy loss mechanisms and the production rate of the novel particle responsible for the nonstandard cooling.
The general agreement between the observed WDLF and predictions from standard astrophysics has been used to place bounds on the axion-electron coupling \citep{Isern:2008nt,Bertolami:2014wua}, on the anomalous neutrino magnetic moment \citep{Bertolami:2014noa}, on the kinematic coupling of dark photons to standard photons \citep{Chang:2016qfl}, and on the variation of the gravitational constant \citep{Althaus:2011ca}.
However, several recent analyses of the WDLF have shown a preference for additional energy loss with respect to the Standard Model predictions.
In particular, \cite{Bertolami:2014wua} used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SCSS) to show a $2 \sigma$ discrepancy from the Standard Model prediction, which could be explained by axions coupling to electrons with $g_{\phi e}\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-13}$.\footnote{The additional energy can also be accounted for by dark photons~\citep{Giannotti:2015kwo,Chang:2016qfl}, but not by anomalous neutrino electromagnetic form factors~\citep{Bertolami:2014noa}.}
These measurements of the WDLF have guided experimental searches for axions and ALPs, particularly the IAXO~\citep{Irastorza:2011gs,Armengaud:2014gea}, and ALPS II~\citep{Bahre:2013ywa,ALPSII} experiments.

Observations from the \Gaia satellite have already increased the catalog of WDs by an order of magnitude with respect to SDSS \citep{1805.01227,1807.02559,1807.03315}.
The growing sample of WDs with precisely measured distances will enable an improved measurement of the WDLF.  
However, the completeness of the \Gaia sample is limited to WDs within 100 pc~\citep{1807.03315}.
%Oscar. In the GAIA DR2 about 260.000 WDs have been identified. However the sample is complete up to G=20-21, only for those within 100 pc, which are about 11.000 stars. The major problem is that the completeness drops at low Galactic latitudes, and the magnitude limit of the catalogue varies significantly across the sky as a function of Gaiaâ€™s scanning law.  A larger and more complete sample will be certainly available with the final data release.
LSST is expected to detect WDs that are 5 to 6 magnitudes fainter than those detected by \Gaia, ultimately increasing the census of WDs to tens of millions~\citep{0912.0201}.
LSST will provide more complete and homogeneous samples of WDs, allowing for a significant reduction in both the statistical and systematic uncertainties in measurements of the WDLF. 
LSST is expected to measure hundreds of thousands of WDs in the Galactic halo, enabling the construction of a reliable luminosity function of halo WDs. 
By deriving independent WDLFs from different Galactic populations it will be possible to reduce uncertainties related to star formation histories, and to ultimately provide a more clear assessment of the physical origin of the cooling anomalies \citep{Isern:2018uce}. 

The growing sample of WDs will similarly increase the known population of variable WDs with pulsation periods of 100s--1500s. 
Measured changes in the pulsation periods of WDs can be used to directly constrain the rate of cooling \citep[\eg][]{1007.2659}.
Indeed, hints of anomalous cooling from axions have been claimed \citep[\eg][]{Corsico:2012ki,Corsico:2012sh}, though more recent analyses set upper limits at the level of $g_{ae} < 3.3 \times 10^{-13}$ \citep{Battich:2016htm}. 
LSST will greatly increase the sample of pulsating WDs, enabling high-cadence follow-up observations to precisely measure changes in pulsation period and probe anomalous cooling mechanisms.


\subsection{Globular Cluster Stars}

Massive stars, specifically those close to the helium burning phase, provide another excellent environment to study anomalous energy loss mechanisms. 
Stellar evolutionary codes such as MESA \citep{1009.1622} provide a good model for the evolution of massive stars, allowing constraints to be placed on novel particle production \citep[\eg,][]{1210.1271,1611.05852}.
Several recent analyses of giant branch stars have reported deviations from standard stellar model predictions that can be interpreted as a signature of anomalous energy loss.
For example, studies have shown a brighter-than-expected tip of the RGB (TRGB) in the M5 globular cluster~\citep{Viaux:2013lha,Viaux:2013hca}, indicating somewhat over-efficient cooling during the evolutionary phase preceding the helium flash.
The anomalous brightness, $\Delta M_{I,{\rm TRGB}}\simeq 0.2$ mag in absolute $I$-band magnitude, observed in M5 can be interpreted as an anomalous cooling of a few $10^{33}$ erg/s.
Such cooling could be accounted for by a neutrino magnetic moment or an axion-electron coupling of the order of that predicted from the WDLF~\citep{Viaux:2013lha}. 
These constraints can be improved using multi-band photometry of multiple globular clusters \citep[\eg,][]{Straniero:2018fbv}.

Advances in the analysis of globular cluster RGB stars are currently limited by modeling uncertainties on the stellar evolution of the giant branch.
Fundamental improvements should be expected in the near future. 
In particular, exquisite astrometry from the {\it Gaia} satellite will precisely determine cluster distances, currently the largest sources of observational uncertainty in the determination of the absolute luminosity of the TRGB.\footnote{The {\it Gaia} data relevant for GCs are expected in 2022~\citep{Gaia}.}
Moreover, the angular resolution of the next-generation space-based missions, such as JWST~\citep{Gardner:2006ky}, will enlarge the statistical sample of RGB members near the cores of GCs. 
The brightness of RGB stars in nearby GCs limits the contributions of LSST, which saturates at $g \sim 17$ mag and suffers from crowding near the cores of GCs.
However, LSST will enable independent measurements of GC distances, providing a valuable handle on systematic uncertainties of {\it Gaia} observations.\footnote{The parallaxes of bright ($G<14$ mag) sources can be derived with a median uncertainty of 0.04 mas in {\it Gaia} DR2. However, for fainter stars the parallaxes become sensitive to systematic errors.  Presently, these systematics hamper a precise determination of GC distances \citep{Chen:2018}.}
Moreover, it is likely that the homogeneity and precise photometry of LSST will improve the calibration of the bolometric corrections for RGB and HB stars and ultimately contribute to a more clear assessment of the cooling of GC stars.


\subsection{Massive stars and core-collapse supernovae}

The cores of massive stars are among the most powerful natural laboratories to investigate the possible production of weakly interacting light particles, particularly axions. 
The energy loss rate via axions is quite sensitive to temperature. 
For instance, the rate of the Primakoff process (the photon-axion conversion in the static electric field of ions and electrons) scales as $T^4$. 
\figref{massivestar} shows the evolution of the neutrino and axion luminosities in a $18\Msun$ star. 
After He burning, the central temperature rapidly increases, becoming larger than $10^9$ K. 
In standard stellar models (no axions or other non-standard cooling), the energy loss by neutrinos largely overcomes the energy loss by photons. This rapidly decreases the evolutionary time scale and determines the chemical and physical structure of the star at the onset of core collapse. 
In this context, an additional energy loss mechanism may significantly affect the pre-explosive stellar structure and, in turn, may determine the success or failure of a core collapse supernova (CCSN). 
Such an effect may be revealed by connecting CCSNe to their massive star progenitors, something that will be enabled by the wide area and high temporal cadence of LSST.

Another powerful strategy by which novel particles can be constrained is by considering the evolution of the neutrino cooling phase of nearby SNe  \citep[\ie, SN1987A][]{Burrows:1988, Raffelt:1988}.
The simplest and most robust method by which such constraints can be implemented is the so-called ``Raffelt criterion,'' which limits the luminosity of new particles to be below the luminosity of neutrinos during the neutrino-cooling phase \citep{hep-ph/0611350}.
Neutrino observations of SN1987A have been used to place limits on a wide variety of new particles \citep{hep-ph/0207098, 1611.03864, 1611.05852, 1803.00993, 1808.10136}.
Again, it is possible that a subdominant release of energy into new particles is responsible for resolving some lingering inconsistencies with the Standard Model-only picture of CCSNe explosions \citep{0806.4273, 1805.07381}, though such an effect is difficult to resolve analytically on top of other qualitative uncertainties of the Standard Model-only picture \citep{1809.05106, 1811.11178}.
LSST, in combination with upcoming neutrino experiments (i.e., DUNE), will help reduce Standard Model uncertainties and expand this analysis to future and more distant CCSNe \citep{1807.10334}.

LSST is expected to discover $\roughly 3.5\times10^5$ CCSNe per year \citep{Lien:2009}. 
%\ADW{Better to update this from Goldstein et al. (2018).}\AHGP{I think the Goldstein ref is with respect to lensed SNe}\ADW{Goldstein starts from a full population analysis, which is what we would take.}
For nearby SNe, LSST will be able to resolve massive progenitor stars in pre-explosion imaging. 
So far, a clear identification of progenitor stars has been obtained only for about 20 type II SNe \citep{Smartt:2015}.  
The identification of a much larger number of massive stars before they explode is a mandatory step for understanding the CCSNe process and the possible activation of non-standard cooling processes during the late evolution of massive stars. 
Recent theoretical studies have investigated the conditions for which a massive star successfully bounces after core collapse, giving rise to a SN \citep[\eg,][and references therein]{OConnor:2011,Sukhbold:2016}.   
In particular, it was found that the ability to explode predominantly depends on the structure of the progenitor. 
%Therefore, the impact of LSST in this field is twofold: it will constrain the supernova engine and may provide hints for new physics beyond the standard model. 
Therefore, besides providing more clear insight into the SN engine, LSST will provide a solid framework to test the presence of novel cooling channels efficient during pre-SN evolution, constraining or hinting at the existence of axions or other weakly interacting particles.
