\chapter{Dark Matter Probes}
\label{sec:probes}
\bigskip

The theoretical models described in \secref{theory} each produce one or more deviations from the predictions of cold, collisionless, non-interacting dark matter.
These ``probes'' of dark matter physics include: a minimum dark matter halo mass, alterations to the halo density profile, over-abundance of compact objects, anomalous energy loss, and unexpected correlations in large-scale structure.
In some cases, several distinct physical models of dark matter can be probed by the same (or very similar) observables (\eg, keV-mass thermal dark matter and ultra-light fuzzy dark matter). 
%\ET{I'm not sure this eg is necessary?  It seems like a detail discussed below but serves as a distraction in the into?}\ADW{I've shortened it.}
On the other hand, a single probe can manifest itself in a wide range of astrophysical systems (\eg, changes to dark matter profile shape can produce observable effects in systems ranging from clusters of galaxies to dwarf galaxies).
In this section we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive discussion of all possible astrophysical probes of dark matter physics.
Rather, we focus on specific probes and observables where LSST will have a major impact.
%ADW: should we note something like, "major impact alone or in combination with other observation"?
