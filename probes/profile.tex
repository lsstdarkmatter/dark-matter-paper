The standard CDM model predicts that dark matter halos should be ``cuspy,'' \ie with inner density profiles asymptoting to high central densities.
This results from the inability of collisionless dark matter to redistribute kinetic energy, and is born out in numerical simulations which give rise to a family of cuspy halo profiles \citep[\eg, the NFW profile;][]{Navarro:1996gj}.
If dark matter is able to interact through scattering or the exchange of some light mediator (\secref{sidm}), then the density of halos could instead flatten out to produce dark matter ``cores'' \citep{Spergel:1999mh}.
These interactions can also lead to an isotropization of dark matter velocity distribution, leading to more spherical halos \citep{Peter:2013}.
Thus, measurements of the radial density profiles and shapes of dark matter halos are sensitive to the microphysics governing dark matter self-interactions.
Due to the natural possiblity that dark matter scattering has a non-trivial velocity dependence (\secref{sidm}), it is important to probe halo profiles over a wide range of mass scales.
Here we explore the contributions that LSST will make towards measuring the profiles of dark matter halos in isolated small galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
We highlight these systems because they reside at opposite extremes of the galaxy mass spectrum where dark matter dominates over baryonic processes that can also alter the shapes of halos.
